    "text": "Abstract. This research aims to explore future trends in Gold prices as a traditonal safe-haven investment using a Bayesian VARs model. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and especially the 2019 global Covid-19 pandemic, the world economy appears to be on the brink of a looming risk: a world-wide economic recession. The concern over the risk of investment returns has become a primary focus for global investors and financial institutions. This unease has been further exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war(2022) and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2023). Consequently, this research aims to provide a briefly discussion and data-driven forecast of traditional safe-haven assets: Gold, under current circumstances. Factors considered include emerging safe-haven investments, risk-free investment assets, comparable investments, market returns, inflation on both demand and supply sides, broad money supply (M2), interest rates, unemployment rates and market volatility.\nKeywords. Bayesian VARs, Gold price, Inflation, Interset rate, Unemployments, US Bond Yeild, Safe-haven Assets, Forecasting, Volatility, R, Quarto."
