    "text": "Abstract. This study aim to explore future trends in Gold prices using a Bayesian VAR model, examining whether Gold remains a high-quality safe-haven asset in the future. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and especially the 2019 global Covid-19 pandemic, the world economy appears to be on the brink of a looming risk: a global economic recession. The concern over the risk of investment returns has become a primary focus for global investors and financial institutions. This unease has been further exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war(2022) and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2023). Consequently, this research aims to provide a briefly discussion and data-driven forecast of traditional safe-haven assets: Gold under current circumstances. Factors considered include demand and supply dynamics, emerging safe-haven investments, risk-free investment assets, comparable investments, market returns, inflation on both demand and supply sides, broad money supply (M2), interest rates, unemployment rates and market volatility.\nKeywords.
